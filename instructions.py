# Algorithm while I catch up
# Write a Python script to simulate a monopoly game between two players
# Each player should take 1000 turns (not rolls) 
# No bank is kept
# A turn consists of a roll of two 6 sided dice
# if doubles are rolled, the player goes again
# Each roll should be captured to mysql
# Include any extra columns but you must include
# Which player
# Roll total
# Space they landed on as an integer or text
# Bonus
# if the player lands are square 30 the player goes to jail
# This will require a "space ended on” column
# Include Chance and Community chest cards

# When the game is complete, I want a print out of:
# the most common roll per player
# The most common property landed on 
# How often a player lands on square 30 (“Go to Jail”) vs. Free Parking
# How often does the player land on Boardwalk vs. St. Charles Place? St. Charles Place cost $140, Boardwalk costs $400. Which is “better” economically?
# How much money the player makes passing GO (at $200 per pass)
# What is the difference in spaces moved between player 1 and player 2
# BONUS: The property that generates the most rental income after the game passes 100 turns, assuming all properties have hotels. See https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Monopoly/Official_Rules
# BONUS: The distribution of each roll (% of 2, % of 3, etc.)
# SUPER BONUS: The distribution of each monopoly landed on (% of light blue, purple, orange, etc.)
# Import flask stuff
